I'm a fullstack software developer. I started working in 1996 and  I had been learning about programming languages and others technologies since then.

Actually, I can say I may provide you with the ability to analyze, design, configure, test, code and develop many software.

I have experience with several programming and database languages which I can mention C / C ++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, JQuery, Angular, React, MySQL, PostgreSQL (PlPGSQL), NodeJS, C-Ojective, Yii2, Android Studio, Xcode and others.

I'm highly trained to design, test, and develop software.
