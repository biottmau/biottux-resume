I'm a fullstack software developer. I started working in 1996 and  I had been learning about programming languages and others technologies since then.

Actually , I can say I may provide you with the ability to analyze, design, configure, test, code and develop any software.

About technologies, I can highlight the configurations and maintenance of Linux / Unix operating system (Vi, Vim, Bash, iptables, apache2, Lamp, Nginx, crontab, among others).

On the other hand,  programming and database languages I ever worked with, I can mention that I have experience with C / C ++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, JQuery, Angular, React, MySQL, PostgreSQL (PlPGSQL), SQLAnsi , NodeJS, C-Ojective, Yii2, Android Studio, Xcode and others.

I'm highly trained to design, test, and develop software. In-depth understanding of data structures and algorithms. Connoisseur of the Backend development practices. Practical experience in solving software problems, corrective and preventive maintenance.
